# About my city

My city is _called_ Mendoza.It is _located_ in the central western part of Argentina.
A long time ago it _use to be_ a quiet and safe place, but lately it is neither of those.
_There are_ many beautiful places, such as mountains, lakes, vineyards and landscapes.
It is a earthquake city, which is why _its architecture_ is low. It has a checkerboard layout, with many squares and parks.
My _neighbordhood_ is not very nice. It can be a little dangerous, especially at night.
