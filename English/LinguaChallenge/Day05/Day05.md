### Fill in the Gaps with the missing words
In Python, a class <input type="text"/> for creating objects.<br>

Classes  <input type="text"/> that operate on that data into a single entity. <br>

This is  <input type="text"/> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), <br>

which is a  <input type="text"/> objects rather than actions.<br>

### Let's review some key terms:

#### Class:
A class defines  <input type="text"/> ,<br>
including  <input type="text"/> (attributes) and behaviors (methods).<br>

#### Object:
An object is  <input type="text"/> of a class.<br>

#### Method:
A method is a function  <input type="text"/> a class.<br>
It describes  <input type="text"/> objects created from the class.<br>
By using classes and objects, Python  <input type="text"/> , and organized code, which is the essence of Object-Oriented Programming.<br>
